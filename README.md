  Indoor Air Quality Classification Using Machine Learning

# 🏠 Indoor Air Quality Classification Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to classify **Indoor Air Quality (IAQ)** based on data from HVAC sensors. The model predicts air quality as **Good**, **Moderate**, or **Poor** using CO₂, VOC, and humidity readings. It demonstrates the potential of intelligent systems in maintaining healthy indoor environments through automated monitoring.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- 📊 **Sensor Data Used:** CO₂ (ppm), VOC (ppm), and Humidity (%)
- 🧠 **Model:** Random Forest Classifier
- 🏷️ **Labeling Logic:** Based on CO₂, VOC, and humidity thresholds following industry IAQ standards
- 🧪 **Performance:** Achieved 99.9% accuracy with excellent precision, recall, and F1-scores
- 🛠️ **Pipeline Includes:**
  - Data preprocessing and threshold-based labeling
  - Feature selection and label encoding
  - Model training and testing (80/20 split)
  - Performance evaluation using classification report and confusion matrix
- 🌐 **Potential Applications:** Smart HVAC systems, real-time air quality control, and building automation

## 🚀 Future Work

- Add additional environmental features (e.g., PM2.5, temperature, occupancy)
- Test model with real-time data from diverse building environments
- Deploy model to an IoT platform for live monitoring
